    "In this tutorial, you will compute the angular diameter distance as a function of redshift by numerically integrating a function of the Hubble constant. You will then compare your results to that of a tool that you might use in a real research setting - Ned Wright's excellent cosmology calculator. His website also has excellent resources for learning about contemporary physical cosmology. "
